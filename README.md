    <h2>What is an Air Fryer Basket?</h2>
    <p>An air fryer basket is the removable tray in an air fryer where food is placed to be cooked. It sits inside the cooking chamber, and hot air is circulated around it to create a crispy, fried texture without the use of oil. This basket design allows food to cook evenly and quickly, making air frying a popular method for healthy cooking.</p>

    <h2>How Does an Air Fryer Basket Work?</h2>
    <p>The air fryer works by circulating hot air around the food using a fan, which cooks the food and creates a crispy, fried texture. The air fryer basket is designed to allow the air to flow through the food evenly. It often has perforations or a mesh design to maximize airflow and promote even cooking. The basket is typically made of non-stick materials to prevent sticking and ensure easy cleaning.</p>
